# YoloV8-Detection
An implementation of the YOLOv8 model in PyTorch for object detection and image segmentation.
YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art object detection and image segmentation model created by Ultralytics, the developers of YOLOv5. YOLOv8 features a new backbone network, a design that makes it easy to compare model performance with older models in the YOLO family, a new loss function and more.

This project is an implementation of the YOLOv8 model in PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. It allows you to train and test the model on various datasets, such as COCO, VOC, Open Images, etc. It also provides tools for inference, evaluation, and visualization of the results.
# Installation and Usage
To use this project, you need to have Python 3.8 or higher and PyTorch 1.7 or higher installed on your system. You also need to install some additional packages, such as numpy, opencv-python, matplotlib, etc. You can install them using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Copy
To train the model on a custom dataset, you need to prepare your data in the following format:

dataset/
  images/
    train/
      img1.jpg
      img2.jpg
      ...
    val/
      img3.jpg
      img4.jpg
      ...
  labels/
    train/
      img1.txt
      img2.txt
      ...
    val/
      img3.txt
      img4.txt
      ...
  data.yaml # dataset configuration file
Copy
Each image file should have a corresponding label file with the same name but with .txt extension. The label file should contain one line per object in the image, with the format: class x_center y_center width height (normalized coordinates). The data.yaml file should contain information about the dataset name, number of classes, class names, and paths to the images and labels folders.

To train the model on your custom dataset, run the following command:

python train.py --data data.yaml --cfg yolov8.yaml --weights yolov8.pt --batch-size 16 --epochs 100
Copy
This will train the model using the yolov8.yaml configuration file and the yolov8.pt pretrained weights on your custom dataset with a batch size of 16 and 100 epochs. You can modify these parameters according to your needs.

To test the model on an image or a video file, run the following command:

python detect.py --source image.jpg --weights best.pt --conf 0.4
Copy
This will run inference on the image.jpg file using the best.pt weights (obtained after training) and a confidence threshold of 0.4. You can also use a video file or a webcam as the source. The output will be saved in the runs/detect folder.
